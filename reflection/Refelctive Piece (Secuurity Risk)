Introduction
This is the 1000 words reflection that follow the Rolfe et al. (2001) What–So What–Now What model (ITC, 2025). This helped to examine my understanding of security and risk management that emerged through the module. It focuses on my experience with the identification of risk, analysis, and mitigation, teamwork in the Pampered Pets project, and their impact on my professional and personal development. Artefacts used to draw evidence include Industry 4.0 discussion (Artefact 2), quantitative modelling exercises (Artefact 1), and the Pampered Pets report (Artefact 4). The reflection shows that theoretical learning, practical modeling, and shared experience in combination increased my technical and professional competence and awareness.
What (Experience)
 To begin with, I attempted to get a grasp of the notion of digitalization as a factor in technological and organizational susceptibility using Artefact 2 (Industry 4.0 discussion). The execution of the framework depicted that user participation is the key to ensuring the risks are identified at the initial stages. The assessment of the 2017 WannaCry ransomware virus (at least 200,000 systems were affected) has provided me with insight into the nature of the interaction between human and technical vulnerabilities and how it can affect my perception of my risk exposure in real life. Unit 8 (Artefact 1) involved quantitative modelling with a blended tool of FMEA and a combination of Bayesian networks and Monte Carlo simulations.
Inputting a daily demand of 100 units (SD 20), lead time of 10 days (SD 3), and 10,000 trial simulations, I obtained a probability of 40 per cent of probability of software-quality failure occurrence and 5-6 per cent risk of stock-out at a service level of 95%. The abstraction of the theory reality was brought about by the making concrete theory of the probability, which related probability to the operational limits through the calculation of Safety Stock ≈ 504 units and Reorder Point ≈ 1,504 units. The ISO/IEC 27005 and NIST CSF v2.0 risk in governance and compliance were then contextualized in the Pampered Pets report (Artefact 4). Phishing, insider error, and weak access control were the most important threats used in the application of the STRIDE model. Concession points - WPA3, MFA, and encrypted hybrid backups, there was a mention of GDPR policies, which implied the presence of qualitative frameworks and quantitative prioritization. 
So What? (Meaning, Growth, Analysis)
The most important contribution I would make to the Pampered Pets project is the development of the STRIDE threat model and measuring the risks following the ISO 27005 in terms of likelihood-impact matrices. I wrote entries on the mitigation, such as the proposal of MFA, vendor-risk reporting, GDPR consent management, and ensured compliance with the ENISA (2023) and NCSC (2023) recommendations. 
The posts of academic materials that I made in the peer discussions (Artefacts 2 and 3) provided me with the possibility to participate in the academic discussion. When discussing Industry 4.0, I have tried to tie theory with real-world examples, including the case of WannaCry and the adoption of AI, within which my peers and I have had more detailed discussions about the issue of GDPR and sustainability risks. In Artefact 3, I compared CVSS and SSVC, using the articles of Spring et al. (2021) and Allodi and Massacci (2017), which demonstrated that less than 30 percent accuracy can deal with real exploitation with the use of CVSS. The discussion was enabled by the use of the arguments supported by information, making it easier to discuss on the premises of evidence-based conclusions (Spring, et al., 2021; Allodi & Massacci, 2017)
The initial work of mine was subjected to tutor feedback, which pointed to the uneven likelihood-impact scales. I responded by recalibrating my matrices according to the NIST SP 800-30 standards and connecting each control to a certain asset and threat. This increased the trustworthiness of our deliverables, besides making me internalize the significance of methodological congruence in SRM.
Teamwork was exasperating and fulfilling emotionally. Controversies arose between the technical and policy-oriented individuals, and I had to resolve the disputes and explain complicated concepts to other team members who were not technical. The process has taught me that cybersecurity leadership is not concerned with superiority in job controls, but rather with the understanding between fields. It also taught me to be patient and understanding when it comes to time pressure as well as interpersonal dynamics.
These observations are indicative of the fact that ISO 31000 requires communication and stakeholder involvement to form part of the risk management process. I also realized that SRM is a people-centred and team-oriented process as much as it is a data-driven and control-oriented process, which changed not only my academic practice but also my professional perspectives.
Now What?
At the individual level, I was more critical and communicative. It also assisted me in building my critical response and evidence-based reasoning as I attempted to ensure that my deliverables were frequently juxtaposed with the academic research (Spring et al., 2021).  Today, I have come to appreciate cybersecurity as an art of strategy that also relates to precision and ethical accountability, and unity between people. 
Moreover, I am interested in learning more about compliance-based security with references to the interaction between ISO 31000, NIST CSF, and GDPR frameworks. The overall professional purpose of mine will be to aid in the creation of strong, evidence-based risk management systems within actual organisational settings. Merging quantitative reasoning with teamwork in the form of communication, I will make sure that my future SRM practice will be both technically and ethically valid.
I will apply the lessons to the systematic action plan in the future. As my short-term goal, I intend to create a template of a reusable risk register that entails the mapping of assets and related threats and vulnerabilities quantitatively with the adoption of ISO/IEC 27005 and FAIR. I shall also continue to use probabilistic modelling methods such as Monte Carlo to improve my analysis.  I have become more aware when I understood that cybersecurity leadership does not imply any type of technical superiority, but, instead, supports interpersonal understanding by facilitating the use of functional disciplines.
Conclusion
In conclusion, this module has changed my approach to security and risk management from abstract theory to systematic, data-driven practice. I developed both analytical competence and emotional intelligence through technical modeling, teamwork, and feedback integration. Now I understand that effective SRM requires a balance between statistical precision, ethical responsibility, and collaborative efforts.
