# Reflective Piece – Security Risk Management Module  
*(Structured using Rolfe et al. (2001) What – So What – Now What model)*

## Introduction
This reflection explores my learning journey during the Security Risk Management module, examining my role within team projects, the development of the Pampered Pets risk assessment, and my personal and professional growth as a cybersecurity student.

---

## What? (Experience)
- **Security and Risk Management Process:**  
  Describe what you learned about risk identification, analysis, and mitigation.  
  Example: *“Initially, I struggled to apply likelihood and impact values correctly, but NIST SP 800-30 helped me structure these assessments.”*

- **Your Role in Team Tasks:**  
  Summarise your responsibilities, leadership, or communication challenges.  
  Example: *“I led the creation of the risk matrix, coordinating between group members to align our methodology with ISO 27005.”*

- **Teamwork Experience:**  
  Discuss collaboration, conflicts, and how you resolved them.  
  Example: *“Balancing differing risk evaluation opinions taught me to mediate and justify decisions using standardised criteria.”*

---

## So What? (Analysis)
- Analyse how these experiences changed your understanding of risk management and teamwork.  
- Refer to tutor/peer feedback and show emotional awareness.  
- Example:  
  *“Tutor feedback on my risk table accuracy helped me shift from a qualitative to a mixed-method approach, improving objectivity. This also improved my self-confidence in presenting data to peers.”*

---

## Now What? (Application)
- Explain how this experience will influence your future academic or professional actions.  
- Example:  
  *“I plan to deepen my knowledge of FAIR and ISO 31000 frameworks to support enterprise-level risk assessments and pursue certification in risk management.”*
