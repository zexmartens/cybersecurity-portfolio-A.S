# Reflective Summary ‚Äì Security and Risk Management  
**Student:** ABDULRAHMAN SALEH ALHAMMADI
**Email:** abdulrahmanalhammadi1986@gmail.com  
**Module:** Security and Risk Management  
**University:** University of Essex Online  
**Date:** October 2025

## The Security and Risk Management Process  
This module transformed my perception of abstract cybersecurity concepts into a **systematic methodology**. Early activities, such as *Artefact 2 (Industry 4.0 discussion)*, deepened my understanding of how digitalisation increases both technological and organisational vulnerability. I learned that **user participation** is essential to identify risks at early stages.

Analysing the **2017 WannaCry ransomware attack**, which infected more than 200,000 systems, helped me connect **human error** with **technical flaws** and understand how both shape real-world risk exposure.  
Through *Unit 8 (Artefact 1)*, I implemented **quantitative modelling** using *FMEA*, *Bayesian networks*, and *Monte Carlo simulations*. With a daily demand of 100 units (SD 20), lead time 10 days (SD 3), and 10,000 trial simulations, I estimated a 40 % probability of software-quality failure and 5‚Äì6 % stock-out risk at 95 % service level.  
This exercise grounded theory in data:  
- **Safety Stock ‚âà 504 units**  
- **Reorder Point ‚âà 1,504 units**  

I later contextualised **ISO/IEC 27005** and **NIST CSF v2.0** within the *Pampered Pets* case study (Artefact 4). Using **STRIDE** modelling, we prioritised phishing, insider error, and weak access control. Countermeasures such as WPA3, MFA, and encrypted hybrid backups complemented **GDPR** compliance, balancing qualitative frameworks and quantitative prioritisation.

## My Individual Contributions to Team Activities  
My most significant contribution to the *Pampered Pets* project was developing the **STRIDE threat model** and quantifying risk using **ISO 27005** likelihood‚Äìimpact matrices.  
I authored mitigation entries proposing **MFA**, **vendor-risk reporting**, and **GDPR consent management**, ensuring alignment with **ENISA (2023)** and **NCSC (2023)** recommendations. I also helped **standardise terminology** between ISO and NIST models to enhance coherence and academic integrity.

As an analyst and coordinator, I organised research, led documentation reviews, and managed version control through Teams. Reviewing peer submissions (*Artefacts 2 & 3*) improved my understanding of academic debate. Discussions on *Industry 4.0* and *WannaCry* strengthened my ability to relate theory to practice.  
In *Artefact 3*, comparing **CVSS** and **SSVC** (Spring et al., 2021; Allodi & Massacci, 2017) revealed that CVSS metrics alone yield <30 % predictive accuracy of real exploitability. This reinforced the value of **evidence-based reasoning** for drawing defensible conclusions.

## My Experience as a Member of a Development Team  
Working collaboratively on the *Pampered Pets* project honed my teamwork and communication skills. Initially, **scheduling and expertise gaps** challenged progress. I promoted an **agile-style workflow**‚Äîshort development cycles and iterative feedback‚Äîwhich improved accountability and cohesion.

The **threat-modelling phase** highlighted tension between technical and policy perspectives. My role involved translating complex quantitative insights into accessible explanations for non-technical peers, strengthening my ability to **mediate** and **simplify complexity**.  
This multidisciplinary experience emphasised that diversity reveals different dimensions of risk: while I focused on statistical uncertainty, others highlighted behavioural or regulatory implications. Reflecting on these perspectives made me more concise, empathetic, and self-aware.

## Impact on My Professional and Personal Development  
This module left a lasting mark on both my **technical** and **professional identity**. I acquired practical skills in **Monte Carlo simulation**, **Bayesian reasoning**, and **probabilistic interpretation** for decision-making. These techniques are directly applicable to **supply-chain resilience**, **business continuity**, and **cyber-risk analytics**.  

I also deepened my understanding of **compliance-based security**, learning to connect **technical controls** with **governance, ethics, and policy**. Security risk management is ultimately about balancing quantitative metrics with qualitative judgement.  

On a personal level, I became more **critical**, **collaborative**, and **evidence-oriented**. I learned to value peer insight as much as my own data, fostering humility and adaptability. This module reshaped my view of cybersecurity as a **strategic discipline**‚Äîone that unites analytical precision with ethical responsibility and human cooperation.
