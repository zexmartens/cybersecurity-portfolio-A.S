## The Security and Risk Management Process  
This module transformed my understanding of security and risk management from abstract theory into a structured, evidence-based discipline. Initially, I explored the role of digitalisation as a factor influencing technological and organisational vulnerability through *Artefact 2 (Industry 4.0 discussion)*. I learned that human engagement and awareness are just as vital as technical solutions in mitigating digital risks. The process of exploring this topic allowed me to connect concepts of cyber-physical systems and human error with organisational resilience.  



The analysis of the 2017 WannaCry ransomware attack, which affected over 200,000 systems globally, revealed how intertwined human and technical vulnerabilities can amplify cyber incidents. This case encouraged me to appreciate the value of proactive risk identification and user training alongside technical countermeasures. In *Unit 8 (Artefact 1)*, I implemented quantitative modelling by combining *Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA)*, *Bayesian networks*, and *Monte Carlo simulations*. By inputting a daily demand of 100 units (SD 20), lead time 10 days (SD 3), and 10,000 trial simulations, I calculated a 40 % probability of software-quality failure and 5‚Äì6 % stock-out risk at a 95 % service level. These findings connected abstract risk theory with measurable outcomes:  
- **Safety Stock ‚âà 504 units**  
- **Reorder Point ‚âà 1,504 units**  



This exercise demonstrated how data-driven modelling supports risk-based decision-making and how statistical tools enhance reliability assessments.  
Later, I applied ISO/IEC 27005:2022 and NIST CSF v2.0 within the *Pampered Pets* case study (*Artefact 4*). Using the STRIDE framework, our team identified key threats such as phishing, insider misuse, and weak access control. Mitigation measures‚Äîincluding WPA3 encryption, MFA, and encrypted hybrid backups‚Äîwere mapped to GDPR and ENISA (2023) guidance. This integration of qualitative and quantitative perspectives illustrated how theoretical models can inform real-world policy and compliance.

## My Individual Contributions to Team Activities  
My primary contribution to the *Pampered Pets* project was developing the STRIDE threat model and quantifying risks using ISO 27005 likelihood‚Äìimpact matrices. I drafted mitigation proposals advocating multi-factor authentication (MFA), vendor-risk assessments, and GDPR consent management, aligning them with NCSC (2023) and ISO 27005 principles. I also harmonised terminology between ISO and NIST SP 800-30 to ensure methodological consistency and academic coherence.  

As analyst and coordinator, I organised weekly meetings, consolidated research inputs, and oversaw documentation through Microsoft Teams. Reviewing peer artefacts strengthened my ability to assess arguments critically and reflect constructively. For instance, when comparing CVSS and SSVC, I recognised that CVSS‚Äôs static scoring often misrepresents actual exploit likelihoods, as discussed by Spring et al. (2021) and Allodi and Massacci (2017). This realisation encouraged me to adopt evidence-based frameworks supported by probabilistic reasoning instead of relying solely on descriptive severity metrics.

## My Experience as a Member of a Development Team  
Working within a multidisciplinary team proved both challenging and rewarding. Initially, coordinating diverse schedules and reconciling differing technical and policy backgrounds required patience and adaptability. Adopting an agile-style workflow with short iterative development cycles, regular check-ins, and continuous feedback‚Äîsignificantly improved team cohesion and accountability.  

During the threat-modelling phase, the team faced differing opinions between those focused on governance and those focusing on technical detail. Acting as a mediator, I simplified complex probabilistic findings into diagrams and plain language explanations, enabling others to grasp essential insights. This process developed my ability to translate analytical results into accessible communication‚Äîa vital skill for future cybersecurity leadership.  

Emotionally, the experience fostered humility and self-awareness. I learned that leadership in cybersecurity is not about dominance but facilitation, ensuring that each voice contributes to a more comprehensive understanding of risk. Disagreements that once frustrated me became learning opportunities about collaboration under pressure. Reflecting on these group dynamics made me more aware of cognitive bias, emotional intelligence, and ethical responsibility in professional environments.

## Impact on My Professional and Personal Development  
This module profoundly influenced my professional trajectory and confidence as an emerging cybersecurity specialist. I have developed proficiency in Monte Carlo simulation, Bayesian reasoning, and quantitative risk assessment, directly applicable to domains such as supply-chain resilience and business continuity planning. Integrating these analytical tools into real-world risk evaluation has strengthened my technical identity and prepared me for leadership roles requiring both precision and contextual awareness.  

Through the lens of ISO 31000 and NIST SP 800-30, I now view security risk management as a strategic discipline balancing statistical precision with ethical and qualitative reasoning. I have also grown more adept at aligning technical outcomes with organisational governance frameworks and legislative compliance requirements such as GDPR and Cyber Essentials.  

On a personal level, the project enhanced my critical thinking, emotional regulation, and interpersonal skills. I have become more reflective, better at giving and receiving feedback, and more conscious of how group learning contributes to professional maturity. Comparing the Unit 6 status document with the final Unit 11 project made our team‚Äôs progression evident: the early version emphasised descriptive threats, whereas the final report integrated quantitative scoring, mitigations ranked by cost-benefit analysis, and explicit mapping to ISO 27005. This improvement demonstrates not only technical evolution but also my capacity to apply learning iteratively across the module.  

Looking forward, this module has inspired me to pursue advanced study in cyber-risk analytics and penetration testing as part of my personal development plan (PDP). I intend to apply the same structured, evidence-based approach in my future professional projects and contribute to developing secure, resilient digital systems that align with international best practice.
