## Module Overview  
The **Security and Risk Management (SRM)** module developed my ability to apply international cybersecurity risk standards in practical, team-based environments.  
It integrated **technical, managerial, and human factors**, teaching me to analyse threats and design mitigations based on quantitative and qualitative evidence.  

The module introduced:
- **ISO/IEC 27005:2022** and **NIST SP 800-30** for structured risk management  
- **STRIDE**, **FMEA**, and **Monte Carlo simulation** for threat modelling  
- Integration of **GDPR**, **ENISA**, and **NCSC** frameworks  
- Continuous improvement through **agile teamwork** and **reflective practice**

## Learning Objectives  
1. Understand and apply structured risk management methodologies.  
2. Quantify and visualise risk through data-driven simulation and modelling.  
3. Translate between technical analysis and business/ethical implications.  
4. Collaborate effectively across multidisciplinary teams.  
5. Reflect critically on personal and professional growth.

## Reflection Snapshot  
This module shifted my understanding of cybersecurity risk from theoretical compliance to **data-driven and ethically grounded practice**.  
I learned to balance **quantitative precision** (Monte Carlo, Bayesian inference) with **qualitative reasoning** (policy, governance, and teamwork).  
The process improved my confidence in leading group tasks, communicating results, and applying reflective techniques for continuous professional development.
