# Module Overview – Security and Risk Management  
**Module:** Security and Risk Management  
**Student:** ABDULRAHMAN SALEH ALHAMMADI  
**University:** University of Essex Online  
**Programme:** MSc Cyber Security  
**Date:** October 2025  

---

## Module Description  
The *Security and Risk Management (SRM)* module provided an in-depth understanding of how to identify, evaluate, and mitigate cybersecurity risks in modern organisations. It explored both **quantitative** and **qualitative** risk analysis methods aligned with *ISO/IEC 27005 (2022)* and *NIST SP 800-30 (2012)* frameworks.  

Throughout the module, I developed skills in risk modelling, mitigation planning, and collaborative communication within multidisciplinary teams. The learning journey was supported by case studies such as *Pampered Pets* and industry examples like *WannaCry (2017)*, which reinforced the connection between human factors, governance, and technology.

## Key Learning Outcomes  
- Applied international standards (**ISO 27005**, **NIST CSF**) to real-world risk scenarios.  
- Designed and interpreted quantitative models using **Monte Carlo**, **FMEA**, and **Bayesian analysis**.  
- Developed a **STRIDE threat model** for the *Pampered Pets* case study.  
- Linked **GDPR**, **ENISA**, and **NCSC** guidance to security controls and governance measures.  
- Enhanced teamwork, documentation, and mediation skills within agile environments.  
- Reflected critically on personal and professional growth using **Rolfe et al. (2001)** framework.
