## 🧭 Overview
This GitHub repository hosts my **Academic e-Portfolio**, documenting my learning journey across the MSc Cyber Security programme.  
It includes artefacts, reflections, feedback, and references from each module — demonstrating both technical growth and professional development.

Each module folder contains:
- An **overview** summarising module outcomes.  
- **Artefacts** (reports, code, or analyses) showcasing applied learning.  
- A **reflection** following Rolfe et al. (2001) *What – So What – Now What* model.  
- **References** in Harvard style.
