# Evaluation: Unit 6 Status Document vs Unit 11 Final Project

This evaluation compares the initial status document created in Unit 6 with the final project completed in Unit 11 to demonstrate growth and progress.

| Aspect | Unit 6 Status Document | Unit 11 Final Project | Improvement |
|--------|------------------------|------------------------|--------------|
| **Risk Framework** | Basic use of ISO 27005 | Combined ISO 27005 + NIST SP 800-30 | Broader methodology |
| **Threat Identification** | Focused on external threats only | Expanded to insider and supply-chain risks | Improved scope |
| **Documentation Quality** | Limited evidence and feedback integration | Fully annotated with peer/tutor comments | Academic integrity strengthened |

### Summary
This comparison highlights how feedback and team reflection significantly improved both the structure and the analytical depth of my final risk assessment.
